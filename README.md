AL_Tank_game
============

A tank game similar to NES era games written in Allegro 5.0.10

This is a game in progress!!!
-----------------------------

So don't expect anything playable yet... I mean, we are not even in alpha, not even prototype.


What I am doing right now?
---------------------------

*Well*...

  * Finding good foundation libraries so I dont reinvent the wheel again.
  * Sketching Core game systems and interactions between libraries.
  * Investigating a little about AI and game implementations of it (very ##VERY## tedious)
  * Enyoing a good read of [game programming patterns](http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com).
  * Testing colors and styles so THEN start doing some artwork.
  * Having a life apart of this...
  * You get the idea
